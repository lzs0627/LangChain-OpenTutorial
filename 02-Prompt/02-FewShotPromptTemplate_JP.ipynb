    "## 概要\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain の few-shot プロンプトは、注意深く選ばれた例を与えることで言語モデルが高品質な出力を生成するのを導くための強力なフレームワークを提供します。この手法は必要な明示的な指示の量を最小化し、モデルに望ましい出力の構造やスタイルを学習させやすくします。\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Few-shot プロンプトテンプレート** : 例を埋め込むことでプロンプトの構造や形式を定義し、モデルが一貫した出力を生成するのを導きます。\n",
    "- **例の選択戦略** : クエリに対して最も関連性の��い例を動的に選択することで、モデルの文脈理解と応答精度を向上させます。\n",
    "- **Chroma ベクトルストア** : セマンティック類似性に基づいて例を格納・検索するための強力なユーティリティで、スケーラブルかつ効率的なプロンプト構築を可能にします。\n",
